#### My old website. View it [here](http://chrisperkins.me/Chris-Perkins.github.io-OLD/)

A website written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that has the likeness of a terminal.

Does not work on Internet Explorer due to a lack of "class" implementation in JS, but who cares about Internet Explorer anyway?
